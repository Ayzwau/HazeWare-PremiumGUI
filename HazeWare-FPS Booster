Delete = { SurfaceAppearance = true, FaceControls = true }--[[ The reason for these bools (toggles):
SurfaceAppearance - affects the way some textures look and may make some games unplayable (more info - https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/SurfaceAppearance)
FaceControls - set to false if you are wearing an animated face yourself. Otherwise it will be detectable as this removes all animations from all faces including yours making yours resemble a pokerface which is NOT normal and IT REPLICATES (more info - https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/FaceControls)]]
